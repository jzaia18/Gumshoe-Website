      <h2 id="education-section">Education</h2>

      <h3 id="education-section">My Education</h3>
      <p class="about-p">
        I will be graduating from Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) with a master's degree in computer science (MSCS) in December 2024.
        My main area of study is theoretical computer science with a focus on quantum computing.
        <!-- Eventually, I plan to pursue a PhD with an emphasis on theoretical aspects of quantum computing, namely algorithm complexity, circuit optimization, and error correction. -->
        Prior to coming to CMU, I graduated from the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) with a BS in computer science in 2023.
        While there, I specialized in theoretical computer science and cybersecurity, and completed a triple minor in mathematics, quantum information science and technology, and computing security.
        Fun fact: I was the first ever person to graduate RIT with the quantum information science and technology minor, since it was first offered the year of my graduation.
      </p>

      <h3 id="teaching-section">Teaching</h3>
      <p class="about-p">
        For the fall semester of 2024 I am designing and running a <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/stuco">StuCo</a> at Carnegie Mellon.
        This 3 unit (1 credit) course called <a href="https://intuitiveqcomp.jzaia.net">Intuitive Quantum Computing</a> aims to bring quantum computing concepts to an undergradutate level.
        The goal is to break down concepts into a simple digestible form for a more thorough understanding that does not rely on the mindset of "shut up and calculate".
        The focus is on the computational aspects of quantum computing such as computational models, algorithms, complexity theory, and cryptography.
        This course is targeted at students with a moderate computer science background, particularly students in their 2nd to 3rd year of a computer science or related bachelor's degree.
      </p>

      <h3 id="tutoring-section">Tutoring</h3>
      <p class="about-p">
        I am a lifelong teacher and tutor.
        I started my tutoring career as a volunteer in high school, and continued into the private sector in college via <a href="https://www.wyzant.com/Tutors/JakeZCSTutoring">Wyzant</a>.
        I love helping people learn and grow as I teach them computer science and mathematics in a way that's easy to understand.
        In total I have almost 10 years of tutoring experience in both computer science and mathematics, at the middle school, high school, college, and adult level and over 1,250 hours of experience on Wyzant alone.
        This experience spans various programming languages and paradigms, and covers fields from computing fundamentals to object oriented languages to operating systems, pure theory, embedded development, algorithm optimization and computer graphics.
      </p>

      <h3 id="tutoring-section">Communities</h3>
      <p class="about-p">
        I am a moderator over at <a href="https://reddit.com/r/QuantumComputing">r/QuantumComputing</a> where I help remove bot &amp; spam posts and ensure discussions are high quality.
        I am also a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Jzaia">Wikipedia contributor</a>, helping share knowledge with the world, primarily for quantum computing topics.
      </p>

      <h2 id="work-section">Work</h2>
      <p class="about-p">
        During my college career I have worked a series of internships spanning a wide breadth of computer science topics.
        Most recently, I have worked at the <a href="https://www.sei.cmu.edu">Software Engineering Institute (SEI)</a> helping to conduct novel research in several roles.
        My current role involves identifying and solving issues with creating fault-tolerant quantum systems.
        Prior roles have involved analysis of data compression and creating test environments for ML-enabled security systems.
        I have also worked for <a href="https://mitre.org">MITRE</a> in both a development and research capacity.
        My research was involved in symbolic manipulation of qubit states, whereas my development roles were mostly associated with an internal resource management research project and the F-35 project.
        Earlier in my career, I worked for <a href="https://www.herricktechlabs.com">Herrick Technology Labs</a>, as an embedded software developer working on software defined radio systems, and for <a href="https://www.morganstanley.com">Morgan Stanley</a> as a web developer for an internal website.
        I'm always open to explore new opportunities to grow more as a developer.
      </p>
      <p class="about-p">
        For a more detailed list of everything I've worked on, please see <a href="static/resume/resume.pdf">my resume</a>.

      <p class="about-p">
        This website, in addition to being open source itself, is being hosted through <a href="https://mailinabox.email">Mail-in-a-box</a>, which is an open source implementation of a mail, file storage, and HTTP server.
        I am an active participant in and proponent of the free and open source community throughout the internet, my community, and especially at RIT, where I served as secretary and then president of the <a href="https://ritlug.com">RIT Linux User's Group</a>.
        I love linux-y things, and encourage wider adoption of Linux for both technical and ethical reasons wherever I can.
      </p>

      <h3 id="tutoring-section">Hackathons</h3>
      <p class="about-p">
        Moreover, I am a frequent attendee of hackathons, and have attended well over 20 across the state of New York and the surrounding area.
        My teams and I always enjoy working hard to produce something interesting, whether it be for the betterment of society or just to make something fun.
        For examples of some of these projects, please visit <a href="https://github.com/jzaia18/Major-Projects">my portfolio</a>, which lists many of my hackathon, personal, and school projects.
        I have also mentored hackathons on occasion and provided administrative and technical knowledge to participants and organizers.
        In addition, I am a <a href="https://github.com/RockstarLang/rockstar">Certified Rockstar Developer</a> and contributor to the Rockstar Language project and community.
